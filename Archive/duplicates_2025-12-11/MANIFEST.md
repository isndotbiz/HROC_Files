# Duplicate Files Archived - 2025-12-11

## Summary
- Moved full `ALL_PDFS/` folder to `Archive/duplicates_2025-12-11/ALL_PDFS/`.
- Canonical, site-facing copies now live in `HROC_Website_New/pdfs/`.
- No changes made to existing archive/markdown duplicates.

## Rationale
`ALL_PDFS/` contained exact duplicates of every PDF already placed under `HROC_Website_New/pdfs/`. To reduce clutter and avoid double-maintenance, the original bundle was archived.

## Locations
- Canonical: `HROC_Website_New/pdfs/` (used by documents.html)
- Archived duplicates: `Archive/duplicates_2025-12-11/ALL_PDFS/`

## Notes
- Other duplicate markdown files already live entirely under `Archive/` and were left untouched to avoid disturbing historical records.
