\*\*Adopted:\*\* July 30, 2025 ▪ \*\*Next Review:\*\* July 2026

\-\--

\## 1. Purpose & Scope

Ensure proper internal controls over all financial transactions, reimbursements, grants, asset 

management, and cash handling, aligned with COSO Principles and IRS expectations for charities.

\## 2. Management of Financial Authority & Segregation of Duties

- No person may request, approve, and reconcile the same transaction

- Dual signature required for all disbursements over \$500; Treasurer and Chair must sign

- Peer travel or small reimbursements (\<\$100) require supervisor approval and receipts

\## 3. Cash Management

- Petty cash fund (max \$200, locked and reconciled monthly)

- All expenses supported by original receipts or digital image

\## 4. Bank Reconciliation & Monthly Reporting

- Finance Committee/Treasurer reviews monthly bank account and SPV bank statements and logs

reconciliation

- All expenses must be logged into Xero (or QuickBooks) within 5 business days

- Financial summary with variances shared at every board meeting

\## 5. Fiscal Year Budget Approval & Amendment

- Annual budget proposed by Treasurer, reviewed by Finance Committee, and approved by Board

in advance of fiscal year

- Amendments above 10% of line-item must be approved by Board

\## 6. Grants & Expense Categorization

- Each grant reference (e.g., SUPTRS, BEN Cheney) tracks separate grant code and project tag

- Only approved expenses consistent with the grant's budget allocation are reimbursed

\## 7. Travel, Mileage & Reimbursements

- HROC reimburses mileage at IRS 2025 Standard Rate (e.g. \$0.67/mile) for outreach sites after

logging usage via SPV logs

- All volunteer mileage and vehicle usage must be entered and signed by SPV Manager

\## 8. Asset Management & Insurance

- RV, medical supplies, electronics, and signage must be listed in the Asset Register with

acquisition date, cost, depreciation schedule, and insured value

- SPV Manager reviews insurance annually and flags changes to Board

\## 9. Fraud and Financial Integrity

- Suspicious or unusual transactions reported to Treasurer or Chair immediately

- Finance policies include abuse mitigation: whistleblower protections, documented oversight, and

audit trails.

\## 10. Audit & Accountant Review

- If gross receipts exceed \$200,000 or assets exceed \$500,000, HROC will engage a CPA to

conduct a formal audit

- Annual CPA (or Finance Committee) review is done even under thresholds

\## 11. Policy Review

- This policy is reviewed annually in July by the Finance Committee and approved by the Board
