—) Grant-Focused Executive Summary

Healing Roots Outreach Collective (HROC) is a newly incorporated 501(c)(3) nonprofit based
in Western Washington providing Indigenous-led, trauma-informed mobile harm reduction
services to street-involved and unhoused populations. HROC was founded in July 2025 by three
experienced outreach workers and peer advocates—Jonathan Mallinger, Lilly Fedas, and
Brianna Bear—each with over 20 years of lived and professional engagement with drug-using
communities.

Operating out of a fully equipped 2020 Coachman Freelander RV, the organization delivers
low-barrier, street-based overdose prevention services, wound care, and peer-led cultural
wellness grounded in Indigenous healing values. HROC is positioned to serve King and Pierce
Counties, where opioid-related mortality has increased over 200% since 2016 and there is a
documented lack of culturally appropriate, mobile care options.

We seek initial funding to pilot and scale our Mobile Wellness Unit, with a 12-month goal of
reaching 2,500 individuals, distributing 10,000 naloxone doses and safe use kits, and
connecting 500 individuals to housing, MAT, and detox pathways. Our services include:

Syringe services and safe disposal

Naloxone training and distribution

Fentanyl testing education

Basic wound care and triage

Peer-based crisis response

Housing, ID, and detox referrals

Cultural wellness support circles and smudging (with Indigenous advisory oversight)

Our board structure includes a long-term vision for Indigenous governance transition. A
half-Native cultural coordinator and a quarter-Native equity liaison ensure that all service
delivery is guided by the needs and voices of the communities we serve. The current
Indigenous figurehead and founding board member, though in recovery, serves in an advisory
cultural role and is central to future leadership planning.

We are applying for grant support to:

Fund initial staffing and outreach team stipends

Retrofit and outfit the RV with clinical and sanitation equipment

Purchase harm reduction supplies (naloxone, sterile syringes, PPE)

Build administrative infrastructure for data tracking, compliance, and reporting
Formalize partnerships with tribal clinics, health departments, and MAT providers

HROC aligns with Washington’s statewide harm reduction priorities as outlined in the Substance
Use and Recovery Services Plan, and the SAMHSA Harm Reduction NOFO’s goals to “increase
community-based overdose prevention services, strengthen harm reduction infrastructure, and
connect individuals to services without coercion.”

Our operating model reflects the proven efficacy of peer-led mobile programs as demonstrated
in programs like Pierce County's DOJ COSSUP-funded van and the 40+ syringe service
programs currently operating in Washington State. Healing Roots stands out by combining this
infrastructure with culturally anchored peer engagement and wraparound referrals designed for
hard-to-reach, Indigenous, and marginalized users.

We respectfully request [insert amount] in first-year funding to stabilize operations, formalize
partnerships, and provide life-saving services during the ongoing overdose crisis.
