\-\--

\## 1. Purpose

Encourage internal reporting of misconduct---fraud, abuse, conflict of interest---without fear. 

Protect organizational integrity.  

Aligns with Form 990 questions and IRS/exempt-status governance best practices.

\## 2. Scope

Applies to all persons serving or representing HROC in any capacity.

\## 3. Protected Disclosures

Good-faith concerns about:

\- Violations of laws, policies, or Codes (e.g. Conflict, Code of Conduct)

\- Misuse of HROC funds or property

\- Gross waste, abuse, or retaliation

\## 4. Reporting Channels

\- Report verbally or in writing to any Board member: Lilly Fedas or Brianna Bear

\- Anonymous submission via Google form or institutional hotline (to be linked)

\- Reports escalate to the Chair and Secretary unless they are implicated

\## 5. Confidentiality

Reported information is kept securely; identities of reporters will be protected to the greatest 

extent possible without compromising investigation integrity.

\## 6. Non-Retaliation

Good-faith whistleblowers are protected from retaliation. Retaliators may face termination or 

removal. This supports 990 Part VI-B compliance.

\## 7. Investigation Procedure

1\. Reports acknowledged within 72 hours

2\. Governance Committee (excluding implicated members) investigates within 30 days

3\. Interim steps may include administrative leave if necessary

4\. Written findings and corrective actions are communicated to involved parties

\## 8. Compliance Officer

Lilly Fedas or her designee receives and logs all complaints; reports annually to the Board.

Maintain written records securely for at least seven years (document retention retention policy).
