Duplicate Archive
=================

- Files in this folder are duplicates (by content hash) moved out of their original locations to keep the main tree clean.
- Canonical copies are retained in HROC_Public (preferred) or the first non-duplicate path found.
- Original relative paths are preserved inside this folder; see manifest.txt for the mapping from moved file -> canonical.
- If you need to restore a duplicate, copy it back to the desired location.
