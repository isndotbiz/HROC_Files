\# HROC Gift Acceptance Policy

\*\*Adopted:\*\* July 30, 2025 ▪ \*\*Next Review:\*\* July 2026

\-\--

\## 1. Purpose & Scope

Ensure gifts accepted align with HROC's mission of mobile harm reduction outreach, cultural 

safety, and equity. Governs cash, securities, real property, in-kind gifts, sponsorships, and 

personal property in all forms. Helps fulfill Form 990 Schedule M response.

\## 2. Types of Acceptable Gifts

- Unrestricted or program-restricted cash to general fund or outreach

- Appreciated stocks, bonds, mutual funds accepted and liquidated unless impractical

- Standard in-kind service or medical supply donations with clear documentation

- Real property only accepted after Board review due to potential liability/cost.

\## 3. Gifts Requiring Board or Committee Approval

- Real estate, vehicles, works of art, intellectual property, or long-term trusts

- Gifts from related persons at over \$5,000 in value

- Any gift that carries restrictions, special maintenance, or potential conflicts

A temporary Gift Acceptance Committee (Board + Finance) can grant exceptions in rare cases.

\## 4. Processing & Acknowledgment

- Donors offering non-cash gifts are encouraged to seek legal or tax counsel. HROC reserves right

to seek its own counsel.

- Gifts valued over \$250 receive a written acknowledgment; gifts above IRS thresholds are

documented on corporate Form 8283.

- Gifts are entered in a ledger of acceptance, with FMV, donor name (or anonymous), and gift

designation.

\## 5. Recording & Reporting

- All non-cash gifts \>\$25,000 reported on Form 990 Schedule M

- Gift registry updated quarterly and audited annually

\## 6. Refused Gifts

- The Board may refuse gifts that:

- Violate mission or create reputational risk

- Are burdensome due to high carrying costs or complexity

- Come with undue restrictions not congruent with strategic goals

Donor is courteously thanked for offer; alternative options may be proposed.
