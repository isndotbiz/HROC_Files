 Why This Policy Matters

A formal Code of Conduct demonstrates HROC's commitment to ethical outreach leadership, 

reinforces public trust, aligns with 501(c)(3) governance expectations, and supports safe, 

compassionate care. It also satisfies guidelines presented by the Council of Nonprofits and 

BoardSource for values‑driven program delivery.  ￼ ￼
