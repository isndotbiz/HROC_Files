## 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE

### Step 1: Set Up Replicate API
```bash
# Get API key from: https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN='r8_your_key_here'
```

### Step 2: Install Replicate CLI (Optional)
```bash
# Using pip
pip install replicate

# Or using npm
npm install -g replicate
```

### Step 3: Generate Images Manually (One at a Time)

```bash
# Example: Generate hero background
replicate run black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro \
  --input prompt="A vibrant, uplifting community health scene..." \
  --input width=2400 \
  --input height=1200 \
  --input output_format="webp" \
  --input output_quality=90 \
  > hero-background-desktop.webp
```

### Step 4: Or Use Python API

```python
import replicate

output = replicate.run(
    "black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro",
    input={
        "prompt": "Your prompt here...",
        "width": 2400,
        "height": 1200,
        "output_format": "webp",
        "output_quality": 90
    }
)

with open("output.webp", "wb") as f:
    f.write(output.read())
```

---

## 📊 OPTIMIZATION TIPS

### Image Compression After Generation
```bash
# Install cwebp for WebP optimization
brew install webp  # macOS
sudo apt-get install webp  # Linux

# Optimize images
for img in *.webp; do
    cwebp -q 85 "$img" -o "optimized_$img"
done
```

### Create Responsive Variants
```bash
# Install ImageMagick
brew install imagemagick

# Create smaller versions for mobile
for img in *.webp; do
    # Create 50% size version for tablets
    convert "$img" -resize 50% "tablet_$img"

    # Create 25% size version for mobile thumbnails
    convert "$img" -resize 25% "mobile_$img"
done
```
