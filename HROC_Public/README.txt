How to use
----------
- **Notion import (recommended):** Zip this folder (`zip -r HROC_Public_Notion.zip HROC_Public`) and use Notion → Import → Upload to bring in the organized tree.
- **Source safety:** Original raw/markdown exports remain in Archive/backup_pre_cleanup.tar.gz and Archive/legacy_raw/; markdowns are in Archive/markdown_backup/.
- **File naming:** All names are ASCII, duplicate hashes removed, truncated titles expanded where possible.

If you need me to further normalize titles (e.g., replacing "Untitled" files with clearer labels after review), let me know which ones to inspect.
