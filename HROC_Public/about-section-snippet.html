<!-- Our Story -->
<section class="card story-section">
  <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
  <div class="story-content">
    <p class="story-paragraph">
      Healing Roots Outreach Collective was born from a fundamental belief: that every person deserves access to life-saving care, regardless of their circumstances. Founded in 2025 in Washington State, HROC emerged from years of frontline experience in harm reduction, peer support, and community health advocacy.
    </p>
    <p class="story-paragraph">
      Our founders witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of stigma, systemic barriers, and limited access to care in communities across the Pacific Northwest. They saw people dying preventable deaths, not from lack of solutions, but from lack of access. They saw individuals with incredible resilience and strength being dismissed, criminalized, and abandoned by systems designed to help.
    </p>
    <p class="story-paragraph">
      HROC was created to change that narrative. We started with a mobile outreach model—bringing naloxone distribution, wound care, basic needs supplies, and peer support directly to encampments, street corners, and community spaces where help was needed most. We built trust by showing up consistently, treating people with dignity, and never requiring sobriety or compliance as a condition for care.
    </p>
    <p class="story-paragraph">
      Today, HROC operates as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, combining the expertise of trained harm reduction specialists, peer support workers with lived experience, and community health advocates. Our work is grounded in evidence-based practices, trauma-informed care, and a deep commitment to social justice. We believe that healing begins with connection, that every life has value, and that communities thrive when we support the most vulnerable among us.
    </p>
    <p class="story-paragraph">
      We're building a future where compassionate, accessible, community-driven care is available to everyone—because no one should have to face their darkest moments alone.
