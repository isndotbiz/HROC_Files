## Accessibility Guidelines

### Alt Text Best Practices

1. **Decorative images:** Use empty alt text (`alt=""`)
2. **Informative images:** Use descriptive alt text provided
3. **Complex infographics:** Consider adding longer descriptions with ARIA
4. **Icons:** Use alt text that describes the function, not the image

### Color Contrast
All images designed with WCAG 2.1 AA standards in mind:
- Text overlays should maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- Use background overlays when needed for readability
- Test with color blindness simulators

### Performance
- Implement lazy loading for below-fold images
- Use responsive images with srcset
- Compress all images appropriately
- Consider using WebP format with PNG fallback
