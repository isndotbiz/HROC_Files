## REORGANIZATION STRATEGY (3x3 Symmetry)

### Current Issues:
- Services section has 7 items (asymmetrical)
- Impact section has 4 items (not grid-friendly)
- Hero stats has 4 items (works as 4x1 or 2x2)

### Proposed Symmetrical Layout:

**Services Section: 3x3 Grid (9 Services)**
```
Row 1: [Overdose Prevention] [Syringe Exchange] [Wound Care]
Row 2: [Health Screening] [Peer Support] [Housing/ID Support]
Row 3: [Cultural Healing] [Education/Training] [Resource Navigation]
```

**Add 2 new services:**
- **Education & Training**: Naloxone training, harm reduction workshops, community education
- **Resource Navigation**: Connecting to housing, healthcare, legal aid, social services
