              <p>Every person deserves someone who gets it. Our peer navigators have walked similar paths and understand the barriers to treatment, housing, and health care. They provide one-on-one support, crisis de-escalation, and connections to medical and mental health services. Through genuine relationship building, we help people navigate complex systems and find hope. We've seen people stabilize housing, access treatment, and reclaim their lives through consistent, caring peer support.</p>
              <p>The power of peer support lies in lived experience and authentic connection. When someone struggling with addiction or homelessness meets a navigator who has been there and recovered, it transforms possibility into reality. Hope becomes concrete, and change becomes achievable.</p>

              reduction services to unhoused and street-involved individuals in King and Pierce
              Counties, Washington.

              We deliver life-saving naloxone distribution, sterile syringe services, wound care,
