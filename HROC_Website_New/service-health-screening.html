          <h2>What is Health Screening?</h2>

          <p>Health screening is preventive healthcare designed to detect health conditions early, monitor vital signs, and identify risk factors before they develop into serious medical emergencies. For individuals experiencing homelessness, substance use disorder, or housing instability, access to basic preventive healthcare is often nonexistent. People go years without seeing a healthcare provider, monitoring blood pressure, checking blood glucose levels, or screening for infectious diseases. By the time symptoms appear, conditions have often progressed to advanced stages requiring hospitalization or emergency intervention.</p>

          <p>Healing Roots Outreach Collective brings comprehensive health screening directly to people on the streets, in encampments, at shelters, and in neighborhoods where traditional healthcare systems don't reach. Our mobile health screening program provides free, confidential, culturally appropriate preventive health services without appointments, insurance requirements, identification, or bureaucratic barriers. We meet people where they are—literally and emotionally—providing care that honors dignity, respects autonomy, and centers the lived experiences of those we serve.</p>

          <p>Health disparities among unsheltered populations are profound and well-documented. People experiencing homelessness have mortality rates three to four times higher than housed populations. Chronic diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease are prevalent but often undiagnosed and untreated. Infectious diseases spread rapidly in congregate living environments. Mental health conditions frequently coexist with physical health challenges. Trauma, both historical and ongoing, creates physiological stress that manifests in measurable health outcomes. Our health screening services address these disparities by removing access barriers and providing consistent, relationship-based care that builds trust over time.</p>

          <p>Our approach to health screening is rooted in harm reduction philosophy and Indigenous healing traditions. We don't require abstinence, sobriety, housing, or any preconditions to receive care. We understand that health exists on a continuum and that small improvements in health status can have profound impacts on quality of life, survival, and eventual pathways to stability and recovery. Every health screening is an opportunity to build relationship, demonstrate care, identify urgent needs, and connect people to resources that support their goals and aspirations.</p>

          <h2>Services Offered</h2>

          <p>Our comprehensive health screening program includes vital signs monitoring, chronic disease screening, infectious disease testing, sexual health assessments, mental health screenings, and linkage to ongoing medical care. Each service is provided by trained peer health workers and licensed medical professionals who understand the social determinants of health affecting the populations we serve.</p>

          <h3>Blood Pressure Monitoring</h3>

          <p>Hypertension is one of the most common and dangerous chronic conditions affecting people experiencing homelessness. High blood pressure often has no symptoms but significantly increases risk of stroke, heart attack, kidney failure, and other life-threatening complications. Living on the streets creates chronic stress that elevates blood pressure. Substance use, inadequate nutrition, lack of sleep, and limited access to medication all contribute to uncontrolled hypertension. We provide regular blood pressure monitoring, track changes over time, educate people about cardiovascular health, and connect individuals with elevated readings to clinics where they can receive medication and ongoing management. For people already prescribed blood pressure medication, we help with medication adherence, refill assistance, and navigation of pharmacy systems.</p>

          <h3>Glucose Testing and Diabetes Screening</h3>

          <p>Diabetes is prevalent among unsheltered populations but frequently undiagnosed until complications like diabetic ketoacidosis, foot ulcers, or vision loss occur. We provide point-of-care glucose testing to screen for diabetes and monitor blood sugar levels for people with diagnosed diabetes who lack regular access to testing supplies. High or unstable blood sugar readings trigger immediate referrals to medical care. We also provide education about diabetes management, help people access testing supplies and insulin, and advocate for people in emergency departments when diabetic emergencies occur. Many people we serve have uncontrolled diabetes complicated by substance use, inadequate nutrition, and inability to store medication safely. We work with people to develop realistic diabetes management strategies that fit their circumstances.</p>

          <h3>HIV and Hepatitis C Screening</h3>

          <p>Rates of HIV and hepatitis C are significantly higher among people who use drugs and experience homelessness compared to the general population. Fear of diagnosis, stigma, lack of transportation, and distrust of medical systems prevent many people from getting tested. We provide rapid HIV testing and hepatitis C antibody screening with results available in minutes. For people who test positive, we immediately connect them to infectious disease specialists, help them navigate the complex process of accessing treatment, and provide peer support throughout treatment. With modern antiviral medications, hepatitis C is now curable in most cases, and HIV can be managed as a chronic condition with viral suppression. Early detection through regular screening is essential to linking people to these life-saving treatments. We also provide pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) education and referrals for HIV prevention.</p>

          <h3>Vital Signs Assessment</h3>

          <p>Comprehensive vital signs assessment includes temperature, pulse, respiration rate, oxygen saturation, and pain screening. These basic measurements can detect early signs of infection, respiratory illness, cardiovascular problems, and other urgent medical conditions. Living on the streets exposes people to extreme temperatures, environmental hazards, and infectious diseases that cause serious illness. A fever might indicate sepsis from an untreated wound infection. Low oxygen saturation could signal pneumonia or chronic lung disease. Elevated heart rate might indicate cardiac problems or withdrawal symptoms. We teach people to recognize warning signs that require emergency care and transport people to hospitals when immediate treatment is needed. For non-emergency findings, we connect people to federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and community clinics that serve uninsured populations.</p>

          <h3>Chronic Disease Screening and Management Support</h3>

          <p>Beyond acute screenings, we conduct comprehensive health histories to identify people living with chronic conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, and mental health conditions. Many people have been diagnosed with chronic conditions in the past but lost access to care and medication after becoming homeless. We help people reconnect with specialty care, access medications through patient assistance programs, and develop management strategies that acknowledge the realities of living unsheltered. For example, someone with asthma needs an inhaler they can carry safely. Someone with heart disease needs medication they can take consistently without refrigeration. We problem-solve with people to address these practical barriers to health management.</p>

          <h2>Health Equity and Impact</h2>

          <p>Health equity means everyone has a fair opportunity to achieve their full health potential regardless of housing status, income, race, or other social determinants. The populations we serve face profound health inequities rooted in systemic racism, poverty, criminalization of substance use and homelessness, and historical trauma—especially for Indigenous people, Black people, and other communities of color who are disproportionately represented among the unsheltered population.</p>

          <p>Our health screening services are designed specifically to address these inequities. We bring healthcare to people rather than requiring people to navigate complex systems. We don't require insurance, identification, or stable housing. We provide culturally appropriate care that acknowledges historical harms and centers Indigenous healing practices alongside Western medicine. Our staff includes peer health workers with lived experience of homelessness and substance use who understand the barriers people face and can advocate effectively within medical systems.</p>

          <p>The impact of accessible health screening is measurable and profound. We've identified hundreds of people with undiagnosed hypertension, diabetes, HIV, and hepatitis C and successfully linked them to treatment. We've prevented hospitalizations by catching infections early and connecting people to care. We've built trusted relationships with people who hadn't seen a healthcare provider in years, opening pathways to addressing mental health, substance use treatment, and other complex health needs. Most importantly, we've demonstrated to people that they matter, that their health matters, and that compassionate, professional healthcare is something they deserve.</p>

          <p>Health screening is often the entry point to broader engagement with our services. Someone who comes for blood pressure monitoring might learn about our syringe exchange program and wound care services. They might meet a peer counselor who helps them apply for Medicaid or disability benefits. They might eventually access housing support or treatment services. Every health screening is an opportunity to plant seeds of connection, hope, and possibility.</p>

          <h2>How to Access Health Screening Services</h2>

          <p>If you're experiencing a medical emergency, please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department. Our health screening services are preventive and intended to catch problems early, but we're not an emergency medical service.

          <p>We work closely with federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), community health clinics, hospital systems, and specialty providers throughout the region. If our screening identifies a health concern that requires ongoing care, we'll help you navigate the process of establishing care with a primary care provider or specialist. We provide warm handoffs, accompaniment to appointments when needed, and advocacy to ensure you receive respectful, appropriate care.</p>

          <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

          <p><strong>Do I need insurance to receive health screening services?</strong><br>
          No. All our services are free regardless of insurance status. If you have Medicaid or other insurance, we can help you access additional services through your coverage, but insurance is never required to receive care from our team.</p>

          <p><strong>Will you report me to police or immigration authorities?</strong><br>
          No. We do not share any information with law enforcement or immigration authorities. Your health information is confidential and protected by healthcare privacy laws. We serve all community members regardless of immigration status, legal history, or other factors.</p>

          <p><strong>What if my screening shows something abnormal?</strong><br>
          If we identify a health concern, we'll talk with you about what it means and what your options are. For urgent findings, we'll help you access emergency care immediately. For non-urgent issues, we'll connect you with clinics and providers who can provide ongoing care. You'll never be forced to do anything—we respect your autonomy and will support whatever decisions you make about your health.</p>

          <p><strong>Can I get health screening services even if I'm currently using substances?</strong><br>
          Yes. We practice harm reduction, which means we provide healthcare regardless of substance use. You don't need to be sober or in treatment to receive our services. We don't judge, and we won't lecture you about substance use. Our goal is to keep you as healthy as possible while respecting your autonomy.</p>

          <p><strong>How long does a health screening take?</strong><br>
          Basic vital signs screening takes just a few minutes. More comprehensive screening with health history and laboratory testing might take 20-30 minutes. We move at your pace and won't rush you. If you need to leave for any reason, that's always okay.</p>
