          <h2>What is Housing & ID Support?</h2>

          <p>Housing is more than shelter. It is safety, stability, dignity, and the foundation upon which healing and recovery are built. Yet for people experiencing homelessness or housing instability, the path to secure housing is often blocked by systemic barriers, discriminatory policies, lack of documentation, and the compounding trauma of poverty and displacement. Healing Roots Outreach Collective's Housing & ID Support program removes these barriers and creates pathways to stable housing for our most vulnerable community members.</p>

          <p>Homelessness is not a personal failing. It is a systemic crisis rooted in inadequate affordable housing, economic inequality, discriminatory housing policies, and insufficient support for people with disabilities, mental health challenges, and substance use disorders. Our housing specialists understand these systemic barriers and work tirelessly to help people navigate complex housing systems, advocate against discrimination, and secure the documentation and resources needed to access stable housing.</p>

          <p>Identity documentation is fundamental to accessing housing, employment, healthcare, and benefits. Yet people experiencing homelessness often lose identification documents due to theft, displacement, or the challenges of living without secure storage. Without ID, people are locked out of housing programs, employment opportunities, and even basic services like opening a bank account. Our ID replacement assistance program helps people obtain birth certificates, state IDs, Social Security cards, and other essential documents, removing a critical barrier to stability and self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>Beyond housing placement and ID replacement, we provide comprehensive case management and benefits navigation. Many people eligible for housing assistance, disability benefits, food assistance, and healthcare don't know how to apply or face barriers in the application process. Our navigators provide hands-on support completing applications, gathering documentation, and advocating with agencies to ensure people receive the benefits they are entitled to. We walk alongside people through every step of the process, from initial application to appeals and ongoing support.</p>

          <p>Our approach centers dignity, autonomy, and cultural safety. We don't push people into housing they don't want or pressure them to accept services that don't align with their goals. Instead, we listen to each person's housing aspirations, assess their strengths and challenges, and develop individualized housing plans that honor their choices and cultural values. For Indigenous community members, we work to connect people with culturally responsive housing options and ensure housing placements respect traditional practices and family structures.</p>

              <h3>Housing Navigation</h3>
              <p>Our housing navigators provide comprehensive support to help people find and secure stable housing. We conduct housing needs assessments, develop individualized housing plans, and connect people with housing programs, subsidized apartments, supportive housing, and landlord partnerships. We help people understand their options, make informed choices, and navigate the often overwhelming process of housing applications and waitlists.</p>
              <p>Housing navigation includes ongoing support once housed. We help people set up utilities, understand lease agreements, address landlord-tenant issues, and connect with community resources. We celebrate housing stability as a major milestone and provide the continued support needed to maintain it. When housing challenges arise, we intervene quickly to prevent eviction and preserve housing stability.</p>

              <div class="service-detail-icon" aria-hidden="true">🛏️</div>
              <h3>Shelter Referrals</h3>
              <p>For people experiencing unsheltered homelessness, emergency shelter can be a critical first step toward stability. We provide referrals to shelters throughout King and Pierce Counties, including low-barrier shelters, family shelters, domestic violence shelters, and culturally specific programs. We help people understand shelter rules and expectations, navigate intake processes, and access shelter beds when available.</p>
              <p>We also advocate for shelter access when people face barriers. Many shelters have restrictive policies that exclude people with pets, partners, or substance use challenges. We work with shelter providers to reduce barriers, advocate for shelter expansion, and connect people with low-barrier and harm reduction-focused shelter options. When shelter isn't available or appropriate, we help people access survival supplies, encampment support, and street outreach services.</p>

              <h3>ID Replacement Assistance</h3>
              <p>Our ID replacement program helps people obtain the documentation needed to access housing, employment, and benefits. We provide hands-on support requesting birth certificates from vital records offices, applying for state IDs and driver's licenses, replacing Social Security cards, and obtaining tribal enrollment documents. We cover the costs of ID replacement when people cannot afford fees, and we advocate with agencies to waive fees when possible.</p>
              <p>ID replacement often requires supporting documentation that people experiencing homelessness lack. We help people navigate verification processes, provide letters of support, and connect people with resources like homeless verification letters and alternative documentation pathways. Our goal is to ensure that lack of ID is never a barrier to housing, employment, or dignity.</p>

              <h3>Benefits Navigation</h3>
              <p>Many people experiencing homelessness are eligible for disability benefits, housing assistance, food assistance, Medicaid, and veterans benefits but face significant barriers accessing these programs. Our benefits navigators provide comprehensive support completing applications, gathering medical documentation, navigating interviews and appeals, and maintaining benefits once approved.</p>
              <p>Benefits navigation is especially critical for people with disabilities and chronic health conditions. Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income provide essential income support, yet application processes are complex and denial rates are high. We connect people with disability advocates, help gather medical records, and support people through multi-year appeals processes. When benefits are approved, the impact is transformative, providing stable income that makes housing and stability possible.</p>

              <h3>Document Assistance</h3>
              <p>Accessing housing and benefits requires extensive documentation: proof of income, rental history, references, medical records, and verification of disability or homelessness status. People experiencing homelessness often lack these documents or face barriers obtaining them. We provide practical support gathering documents, writing letters of support, requesting records from previous landlords and employers, and obtaining homeless verification letters from service providers.</p>
              <p>We also help people organize and maintain documents. Many people experiencing homelessness lack secure storage and lose important papers. We provide document folders, help people make copies, and connect people with mail services and document storage options. Having organized, accessible documentation is critical for housing applications and benefits maintenance.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2>Breaking Barriers to Housing & Stability</h2>

          <p>The barriers to housing are numerous and often interconnected. Poor credit history, eviction records, criminal backgrounds, lack of income, and discrimination based on race, disability, and source of income all create obstacles to accessing housing. Healing Roots Outreach Collective confronts these barriers head-on through advocacy, education, and systemic change efforts.</p>

          <p>We advocate directly with landlords and housing programs to reduce screening criteria, accept alternative documentation, and give people second chances. We provide tenant education so people understand their rights and can advocate for themselves. We document discriminatory practices and work with fair housing organizations to hold landlords accountable. When systemic barriers prevent housing access, we organize, advocate, and push for policy changes that expand housing access for all.</p>

          <p>For people with criminal justice involvement, housing barriers are particularly severe. Many landlords and housing programs exclude people with felony convictions, even decades-old records. We work with housing authorities to expand access for people with criminal backgrounds, connect people with reentry housing programs, and advocate for fair chance housing policies that prevent blanket exclusions based on criminal history. Everyone deserves housing, regardless of their past.</p>

          <p>Source of income discrimination remains a major barrier. Many landlords refuse to accept housing vouchers, disability income, or other non-employment income, excluding people with disabilities and low-income households from housing opportunities. We educate landlords about fair housing laws, advocate for source of income protections, and connect people with landlords and housing programs that welcome voucher holders and people with non-traditional income sources.</p>

          <p>For Indigenous community members, housing barriers are compounded by historical trauma, forced displacement, and ongoing discrimination. We work to connect Indigenous people with culturally responsive housing programs, tribal housing resources, and urban Indian housing authorities. We advocate for housing policies that recognize tribal sovereignty and respect Indigenous cultural practices. Housing justice is inseparable from Indigenous sovereignty and healing from historical trauma.</p>

          <h2>Community Partnerships for Long-Term Stability</h2>

          <p>Housing stability requires more than just a roof over one's head. It requires community support, access to healthcare and mental health services, economic opportunity, and social connection. Healing Roots Outreach Collective partners with a wide network of housing providers, social service agencies, healthcare organizations, and community groups to provide holistic support that addresses the full range of needs people face.</p>

          <p>Our partnerships with rapid rehousing programs, permanent supportive housing providers, and affordable housing developers expand access to housing options. We work closely with King County's Regional Homelessness Authority, Pierce County's Coordinated Entry system, and local housing authorities to ensure our community members are prioritized for housing placements. Through these partnerships, we have helped hundreds of people transition from homelessness to stable housing.</p>

          <p>We collaborate with legal aid organizations to address eviction defense, tenant rights violations, and housing discrimination. When people face eviction or unlawful housing practices, we connect them with attorneys and advocates who can protect their rights and prevent housing loss. Legal support is often the difference between housing stability and homelessness.</p>

          <p>We partner with employment programs, workforce development agencies, and vocational rehabilitation services to help people access job training and employment opportunities. Employment provides income, purpose, and pathways to economic self-sufficiency. For people with disabilities who cannot work, we connect them with disability benefits and supported employment programs that provide meaningful work within their capacities.</p>

          <p>Our healthcare and mental health partnerships ensure that people's health needs are addressed alongside housing. We connect people with primary care providers, mental health counselors, substance use treatment programs, and peer support services. Addressing health needs is essential for housing stability, and housing stability is essential for health. These systems must work together.</p>

          <h2>How to Access Housing & ID Support Services</h2>

          <p>Housing and ID support services are available to all community members experiencing or at risk of homelessness, regardless of background, immigration status, or substance use.
