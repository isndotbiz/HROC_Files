          <h2>What is Syringe Exchange?</h2>

          <p>Syringe exchange programs, also known as needle exchange or syringe services programs (SSPs), are evidence-based public health interventions that provide people who inject drugs with access to sterile syringes and other safer injection equipment. These programs are proven to reduce the transmission of bloodborne infections including HIV, hepatitis C, and hepatitis B, while simultaneously connecting individuals to vital health services, treatment programs, and support resources.</p>

          <p>At Healing Roots Outreach Collective, our syringe exchange program goes far beyond simply distributing sterile needles. We provide comprehensive harm reduction services rooted in Indigenous wisdom, trauma-informed care, and genuine respect for every person we serve. Our peer-led approach recognizes that people who use drugs deserve dignity, healthcare access, and the tools they need to protect their health while navigating the challenges of substance use and systemic barriers to care.</p>

          <p>Research consistently demonstrates that syringe exchange programs save lives and reduce disease transmission without increasing drug use. In fact, studies show that people who access syringe services are more likely to enter treatment programs and reduce their drug use over time compared to those without access to these services. By meeting people where they are with compassion and practical support, we create pathways to healing and recovery that honor individual autonomy and readiness for change.</p>

          <p>Injection drug use carries serious health risks beyond addiction itself. Sharing needles or reusing syringes can transmit HIV, hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and other bloodborne pathogens. Injecting with non-sterile equipment can cause bacterial infections, abscesses, endocarditis, and sepsis. Many people who inject drugs lack consistent access to sterile equipment due to poverty, homelessness, stigma, and criminalization of drug use. Our syringe exchange program addresses these barriers by providing free, confidential, judgment-free access to sterile injection supplies and comprehensive support services.</p>

          <p>The foundation of our work is harm reduction—a philosophy that acknowledges the reality of drug use and prioritizes reducing its negative consequences rather than demanding abstinence as a precondition for care. Harm reduction recognizes that substance use exists on a spectrum and that any positive change, no matter how small, is valuable and worth supporting. This approach aligns deeply with Indigenous healing traditions that honor individual journeys, respect personal autonomy, and recognize that healing takes many forms and follows many paths.</p>

          <h2>Services Offered</h2>

          <p>Our comprehensive syringe exchange program provides a full range of safer injection supplies and support services designed to reduce harm, prevent disease, and connect people to care:</p>

          <h3>Sterile Injection Equipment</h3>
          <p>We distribute sterile syringes in multiple gauges to accommodate different injection practices and vein conditions. All syringes are individually packaged, sterile, and provided free of charge without limits or requirements. We also provide alcohol wipes, sterile cotton filters, clean cookers, sterile water, and tourniquets to ensure people have everything they need for safer injection practices. These supplies significantly reduce the risk of bloodborne disease transmission and bacterial infections that result from reusing or sharing equipment.</p>

          <h3>Safe Disposal Services</h3>
          <p>Environmental safety and community protection are core priorities. We provide puncture-resistant sharps containers for safe disposal of used syringes and other injection equipment. People can exchange filled sharps containers for new ones at any time during our mobile outreach hours. This service protects sanitation workers, first responders, community members, and the environment from accidental needle stick injuries. Proper sharps disposal is a critical but often overlooked component of comprehensive harm reduction.</p>

          <h3>Disease Prevention & Testing</h3>
          <p>We offer rapid testing for HIV and hepatitis C (HCV), two of the most common bloodborne infections among people who inject drugs. Early detection is critical—modern hepatitis C treatments have cure rates exceeding 95 percent, and early HIV treatment allows people to live long, healthy lives and prevents transmission to others. We also provide hepatitis B vaccination series, hepatitis A vaccination, and education on preventing sexually transmitted infections. All testing is voluntary, confidential, and conducted with informed consent and peer support.</p>

          <h3>Overdose Prevention Integration</h3>
          <p>Overdose risk is heightened for people who inject drugs, particularly with the prevalence of fentanyl in the drug supply. Every person accessing our syringe exchange services receives free naloxone kits and training on recognizing and responding to overdose. We also distribute fentanyl test strips that allow people to check substances for the presence of fentanyl before use. This integrated approach addresses the most acute risks facing people who use drugs today.</p>

          <h3>Wound Care & Infection Management</h3>
          <p>Injection-related wounds, abscesses, and skin infections are common complications of drug use, particularly when people lack access to sterile equipment and basic hygiene facilities. Our team provides wound assessment, cleaning, dressing, and monitoring for signs of serious infection. We connect people to emergency care when wounds require surgical intervention and teach self-care techniques to prevent future infections. Wound care is an essential component of comprehensive harm reduction that directly improves quality of life and prevents life-threatening complications.</p>

          <h3>Peer Support & Navigation</h3>
          <p>Our syringe exchange services are delivered by peer outreach workers with lived experience of substance use, recovery, and navigating systems of care. Peer workers build authentic relationships grounded in mutual respect and shared understanding. We provide crisis support, resource navigation, assistance with accessing healthcare and housing, and connections to medication-assisted treatment programs when people express readiness. The peer relationship is often the most transformative aspect of syringe exchange—it combats isolation, reduces shame, and creates space for healing and change.</p>

          <h3>Education & Counseling</h3>
          <p>We offer one-on-one education on safer injection practices including vein care, safer injection sites, reducing infection risk, and recognizing signs of serious complications. We discuss fentanyl risks, overdose prevention strategies, and options for reducing or stopping drug use when people express interest. All counseling is non-judgmental, participant-led, and rooted in respect for individual autonomy and decision-making. We provide information, not pressure or coercion.</p>

          <h2>Impact & Importance</h2>

          <p>Syringe exchange programs are among the most well-researched and evidence-supported public health interventions in existence. Decades of research from around the world demonstrate that these programs:</p>

          <ul class="service-components">
            <li><strong>Reduce HIV transmission by 50 percent or more</strong> among people who inject drugs</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce hepatitis C transmission by 75 percent</strong> when combined with comprehensive services</li>
            <li><strong>Do not increase drug use, crime, or syringe litter</strong> in communities where they operate</li>
            <li><strong>Increase treatment entry rates by up to 5 times</strong> compared to people without access</li>
            <li><strong>Save money</strong>—every dollar spent on syringe exchange saves $7 in healthcare costs</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce emergency department visits and hospitalizations</strong> for injection-related infections</li>
            <li><strong>Protect first responders, sanitation workers, and community members</strong> through safe disposal</li>
            <li><strong>Build trust with marginalized populations</strong> and create pathways to comprehensive care</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The importance of syringe exchange extends beyond disease prevention. These programs address social determinants of health by connecting people to housing, food assistance, healthcare, mental health services, and legal support. They combat stigma by treating people who use drugs with dignity and respect. They reduce the burden on emergency healthcare systems by preventing infections before they require hospitalization. And critically, they keep people alive—creating opportunities for healing, recovery, and transformation that wouldn't exist if disease or overdose had taken their lives.</p>

          <p>In communities heavily impacted by the opioid crisis and the poisoned drug supply contaminated with fentanyl, syringe exchange programs serve as essential safety nets. They provide a consistent point of contact for people experiencing homelessness and substance use who may otherwise be disconnected from all systems of care. The relationships built through regular syringe exchange visits often become lifelines—trusted connections that people turn to in moments of crisis, readiness for change, or need for support.</p>

          <p>For Indigenous communities and communities of color disproportionately impacted by substance use disorders, criminalization, and barriers to healthcare, culturally-informed syringe exchange programs are particularly vital. Our Indigenous-led approach centers cultural safety, acknowledges historical trauma and ongoing oppression, and honors traditional healing practices alongside evidence-based harm reduction. This culturally-grounded care makes our services more accessible, trustworthy, and effective for the communities we serve.</p>

Every interaction is guided by respect, compassion, and a commitment to your autonomy and dignity.</p>

          <h2>Community Impact</h2>

          <p>Since launching our syringe exchange program, we have distributed over 15,000 sterile syringes, provided hundreds of HIV and hepatitis C tests, distributed thousands of naloxone kits, and connected more than 500 people to healthcare, housing, and treatment services. Every syringe distributed represents a potential infection prevented. Every naloxone kit represents a life saved. Every conversation represents an opportunity for connection, healing, and change.</p>

          <p>We measure our success not just in supplies distributed but in relationships built, lives saved, and pathways to healing created. We've witnessed people move from active drug use to stable recovery. We've seen wound infections treated before they became life-threatening. We've responded to overdoses and brought people back. We've connected people to housing, healthcare, and hope. This is the power of harm reduction—meeting people where they are with the tools and support they need to survive, thrive, and heal on their own terms.</p>

          <h2>Commitment to Dignity & Justice</h2>

          <p>People who use drugs are among the most stigmatized and marginalized populations in our society. They face criminalization, discrimination in healthcare, housing instability, and systemic violence. Our syringe exchange program is an act of resistance against this dehumanization. We affirm that every person deserves healthcare, dignity, and support regardless of their substance use. We believe that drug use is a health issue, not a moral failing or criminal behavior. And we commit to advocacy for policy changes that decriminalize drug use, expand access to treatment, and center harm reduction in public health responses.</p>

          <p>Our work is grounded in the understanding that substance use disorders do not exist in isolation—they are deeply connected to trauma, poverty, mental illness, systemic racism, colonization, and barriers to opportunity. True harm reduction addresses these root causes while simultaneously providing immediate, lifesaving interventions. We walk alongside people as they navigate these complexities, offering support without judgment and advocating for the systemic changes necessary to create genuine health equity.</p>
