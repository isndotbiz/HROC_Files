        <!-- What is Wound Care Section -->
        <div class="service-full-description">
          <h2>What is Wound Care?</h2>

          <p>Wound care is a critical component of harm reduction and healthcare for people experiencing homelessness and substance use. Individuals who inject drugs face elevated risks of skin and soft tissue infections, abscesses, cellulitis, and other serious wound complications that can rapidly progress to life-threatening conditions like sepsis, endocarditis, or necrotizing fasciitis. Access to clean water, hygiene facilities, sterile first aid supplies, and medical care is extremely limited for people living on the street, making even minor wounds dangerous.</p>

          <p>Healing Roots Outreach Collective provides professional wound care services directly to people where they are—in encampments, parks, on the street, and through our mobile outreach unit. Our trained peer health workers and medical staff assess wounds, clean and dress them with sterile materials, monitor for signs of infection, provide wound care education, and connect people to emergency medical care when needed. We understand that wound care is not just about treating the physical injury—it's about building trust, demonstrating care, and treating every person with the dignity and respect they deserve.</p>

          <p>Wounds are often a visible sign of vulnerability. When someone shows us a wound and asks for help, they're placing tremendous trust in us. We honor that trust by providing expert, compassionate, non-judgmental care. Our peer-led approach means our team members understand the lived experience of substance use and homelessness. They know the barriers people face in accessing traditional healthcare, the stigma they encounter from medical providers, and the fear many people have of seeking help. That shared understanding creates safety and builds relationships that extend far beyond wound treatment.</p>

          <p>Our wound care services address immediate health needs while also serving as an entry point to comprehensive support. Someone who comes to us for wound care may also need naloxone, sterile syringes, peer counseling, housing navigation, treatment referrals, or other services. By meeting people's immediate needs with compassion and professionalism, we create opportunities to connect them with the broader spectrum of resources they need to move toward stability and healing.</p>

              <h3>Wound Assessment</h3>
              <p>Professional evaluation of all types of wounds including injection-site injuries, abscesses, cellulitis, ulcers, burns, lacerations, and chronic wounds. Our trained health workers assess wound severity, measure depth and size, check for signs of infection, evaluate circulation, and determine whether immediate medical care is needed. We document wound progression and track healing over time.</p>

              <h3>First Aid & Wound Cleaning</h3>
              <p>Sterile cleaning and disinfection of wounds using proper medical technique. We irrigate wounds, remove debris and dead tissue when appropriate, apply antimicrobial solutions, and ensure wounds are properly prepared for dressing. Our first aid kits include everything needed for immediate wound care including gauze, antiseptic, bandages, tape, and specialized dressings for different wound types.</p>

              <h3>Infection Prevention</h3>
              <p>Preventing infection is our primary goal. We educate people on proper wound hygiene, provide sterile supplies for self-care, teach signs of infection to watch for, and follow up regularly to monitor wound healing. For people at high risk of infection, we provide prophylactic supplies and connect them to medical providers who can prescribe antibiotics when appropriate.</p>

              <h3>Abscess Management</h3>
              <p>Abscesses are common among people who inject drugs and can quickly become dangerous. We assess abscesses for severity, provide warm compresses to promote drainage, teach proper care techniques, and make emergency referrals when surgical drainage is needed. We also educate people on preventing abscesses through safer injection practices and sterile syringe use.</p>

              <h3>Chronic Wound Management</h3>
              <p>Some wounds require ongoing care over weeks or months. We provide consistent follow-up care for chronic wounds including diabetic ulcers, venous stasis wounds, and slow-healing injuries. Our team coordinates with medical providers, ensures people have necessary supplies, and provides encouragement and support throughout the healing process.</p>

              <p>When wounds require professional medical intervention—including surgical drainage, IV antibiotics, imaging, or specialist care—we facilitate immediate connections to emergency departments and clinics. We provide transportation assistance, advocate for respectful treatment, and follow up to ensure people receive the care they need.</p>

          <h2>Why Wound Care Matters</h2>

          <p>Untreated wounds are one of the leading causes of emergency department visits and hospitalizations among people experiencing homelessness. What begins as a small cut, injection site injury, or blister can quickly escalate into cellulitis, abscess, or systemic infection requiring hospitalization, IV antibiotics, and sometimes surgical intervention. These emergency interventions are expensive, traumatic, and often preventable with early wound care and basic hygiene access.</p>

          <p>From a public health perspective, accessible wound care prevents costly emergency interventions while improving individual health outcomes. From a human perspective, wound care demonstrates that people's health matters, that they deserve medical attention and respect, and that their lives have value. When someone has been living on the street for months or years, experiencing constant rejection and stigma, a simple act of compassionate wound care can be transformative. It sends the message: "You matter. Your health matters. We care about you."</p>

          <p>Wound care is also an opportunity to address broader health issues. People who come to us with wounds often have other untreated health conditions—diabetes, hepatitis C, HIV, mental health conditions, or chronic pain. Through the relationship built during wound care, we can screen for other health needs, provide health education, and connect people to primary care, specialty care, and treatment services. A wound care visit becomes a pathway to comprehensive healthcare engagement.</p>

          <p>Our trauma-informed approach recognizes that many people have experienced medical trauma, including being refused care, treated with disrespect, reported to authorities, or having their pain dismissed. We create safety by asking permission before touching someone, explaining what we're doing and why, respecting people's autonomy and choices, and never forcing care on anyone. We understand that for many people, asking for help is an act of courage, and we respond with the care and professionalism that courage deserves.</p>

          <p>Wound care saves lives. Serious skin and soft tissue infections can progress to sepsis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and other life-threatening conditions. By catching infections early, preventing complications, and connecting people to medical care when needed, we literally save lives. Every wound we treat is an opportunity to prevent a medical emergency, reduce suffering, and demonstrate that harm reduction works.</p>

          <h2>How to Access Wound Care Services</h2>

          <p>Our mobile outreach team provides wound care services 3-5 days per week throughout King and Pierce Counties. You can find our mobile unit at regular stops in Seattle SODO District, Kent, Tacoma, Spanaway, and other communities. No appointment is necessary—just come to the mobile unit when you need care. Our team is trained to assess wounds, provide immediate first aid, supply sterile wound care materials, and arrange medical transport if emergency care is needed.</p>

          <p>If you have a wound that needs immediate attention, please call or text us at <a href="tel:+12538817377">253-881-7377</a> or email <a href="mailto:admin@hrocinc.org">admin@hrocinc.org</a>. We will do everything we can to reach you quickly. If you believe you have a serious infection—including fever, spreading redness, red streaks extending from the wound, severe pain, confusion, or difficulty breathing—please call 911 or go to the nearest emergency department immediately.</p>

          <p>All wound care services are completely free, confidential, and provided without judgment. You don't need identification, insurance, or an appointment. You don't need to be ready to stop using substances or enter treatment. We meet you exactly where you are and provide the care you need in this moment. Our only requirement is that you let us help you.</p>

          <p>For organizations, service providers, or community members who want to arrange wound care services for a specific location or event, please contact us to discuss mobile unit scheduling. We are committed to reaching every person in King and Pierce Counties who needs our services.</p>

          <h2>Wound Care Education & Prevention</h2>

          <p>In addition to direct wound treatment, we provide education on wound prevention and self-care. Topics include proper injection hygiene, recognizing early signs of infection, basic first aid techniques, keeping wounds clean and dry, nutrition for wound healing, and when to seek emergency care. We provide take-home wound care kits with sterile supplies, written instructions, and our contact information so people can reach us if they have questions or concerns.</p>

          <p>We also address the social and environmental factors that make wound healing difficult for people experiencing homelessness. Lack of access to clean water, inability to rest and elevate injured limbs, exposure to contaminated environments, poor nutrition, and ongoing substance use all complicate wound healing. While we can't eliminate these barriers, we work with people to develop realistic wound care plans that fit their circumstances. We provide extra supplies, arrange for more frequent follow-up visits, and connect people to resources that address underlying needs like shelter, food, and healthcare.</p>
