# 🔄 Officer Transition - Critical Tasks

> **URGENT: Complete these tasks within 7-14 days to update officer structure and state registrations.**

---

## 🚨 Why This Matters

Based on your action plans and board documents, HROC needs to formalize an officer transition:
- **Brianna Bear** → Chair/President
- **Jonathan Mallinger** → Secretary
- **Lilly Fedas** → Treasurer (confirm)

Until this transition is formalized and filed with the state, your public records don't match your actual governance structure.
