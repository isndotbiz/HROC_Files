4. **14 days before:** Technical check
5. **7 days before:** Submit

**Example - Form 990 (May 15):**
- Feb 15: Begin prep
- Mar 15: Draft review (should be 75% complete)
- Apr 15: Final review (100% complete, board approval)
- May 1: Technical check (e-filing credentials tested)
- May 8: File or submit extension

**Standard deadlines use 3-tier system:**
- 30 days before
- 14 days before
- 7 days before
