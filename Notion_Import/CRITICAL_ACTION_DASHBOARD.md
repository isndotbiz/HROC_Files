## 6. FORM HEALING ROOTS ENTERPRISES LLC (FOR-PROFIT SOCIAL ENTERPRISE)

**Priority:** MEDIUM - YELLOW
**Timeline:** Days 60-90
**Owner:** Board Chair (Brianna Bear)
**Estimated Time:** 10-15 hours
**Cost:** $200-400 (filing fees)

### WHY THIS MATTERS
A for-profit social enterprise LLC allows HROC to:
- Generate earned revenue through mission-aligned business activities
- Create sustainable funding beyond grants and donations
- Employ community members and provide job training
- Maintain clear separation from 501(c)(3) charitable activities
- Potentially create unrestricted revenue stream

### IMPORTANT TAX CONSIDERATIONS

**Relationship to HROC:**
- **Option A:** HROC-owned LLC (100% ownership)
  - Profits flow to HROC
  - Subject to Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT) if >$1,000
  - HROC files Form 990-T for taxable income
  - Simpler structure, more UBIT compliance

- **Option B:** Separate For-Profit (0% HROC ownership)
  - Operates independently
  - Can make donations to HROC
  - Can have revenue-sharing agreement with HROC
  - More complex, but avoids UBIT issues
  - Requires separate tax returns (Form 1120 or 1065)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Consult CPA/nonprofit attorney BEFORE forming to determine optimal structure for your intended activities.

### POTENTIAL ENTERPRISE ACTIVITIES (Examples)

**Mission-Aligned Social Enterprise Ideas:**
1. **Harm Reduction Consulting**
   - Training for other nonprofits/agencies
   - Program development consulting
   - Curriculum sales

2. **Educational Product Sales**
   - Harm reduction training materials
   - Educational toolkits
   - Online courses

3. **Conference/Event Services**
   - Hosting harm reduction conferences
   - Workshop facilitation
   - Speaker fees

4. **Peer Support Network Platform**
   - Subscription-based support platform
   - Training certification programs

**CRITICAL:** All activities must be mission-related and not jeopardize HROC's tax-exempt status.

### FORMATION STEPS (If Proceeding)

**PRE-FORMATION (Weeks 1-2):**

**STEP 1: Professional Consultation (REQUIRED)**
- [ ] Consult with nonprofit attorney
- [ ] Consult with CPA specializing in nonprofits
- [ ] Discuss:
  - Ownership structure (HROC-owned vs. separate)
  - Tax implications (UBIT concerns)
  - Revenue-sharing agreements
  - IRS private benefit rules
  - Operational separation requirements

**Questions to Ask:**
- Should HROC own 100%, 0%, or somewhere in between?

**STEP 2: Business Plan Development**
- [ ] Define specific business activities

   - Payment processing

### CRITICAL COMPLIANCE ISSUES

**If HROC-Owned:**

**UBIT Monitoring:**
- Must track all enterprise revenue separately
- If annual net income >$1,000: File Form 990-T
- Pay quarterly estimated taxes if tax liability >$500
- Report on HROC's Form 990 (Part VII, compensation; Schedule R, related orgs)

**Private Benefit Rules:**
- Enterprise cannot primarily benefit private individuals
- All transactions must be arm's length
- Compensation must be reasonable
- Avoid conflicts of interest

**Excessive Compensation:**
- Any compensation to HROC board members or officers requires careful documentation
- Must prove compensation is reasonable for services
- Get comparability data
- Document approval process

**If Separate For-Profit:**

**Tax Returns:**
- File annual tax return: Form 1120 (C-Corp), 1120-S (S-Corp), or 1065 (Partnership)
- Pay federal and state income taxes
- Estimated quarterly tax payments if owed

**Donations to HROC:**
- For-profit can make charitable contributions to HROC
- Subject to normal charitable deduction limits
- Properly document all contributions

**Revenue-Sharing Agreements:**
- Must be arm's length (fair market value)

5. You have business plan with revenue projections

**SUGGESTED TIMELINE:**
- Months 1-3: Professional consultation and business planning
- Months 4-5: Board approval and legal formation
- Months 6-12: Operational launch and first year

**This is lower priority than SPV LLC and officer restructuring. Focus on those first.**

## 7. BUILD BUSINESS CREDIT INFRASTRUCTURE

**Priority:** MEDIUM - YELLOW
**Timeline:** Days 60-90 (ongoing process)
**Owner:** Treasurer (Lilly Fedas)
**Estimated Time:** 5-10 hours initial setup, ongoing monitoring

### WHY THIS MATTERS
Building business credit allows HROC to:
- Finance vehicle purchases (for SPV operations)
- Access business credit cards with rewards
- Obtain better terms with vendors
- Finance equipment and technology
- Establish credibility with lenders and grantmakers
- Separate organizational credit from personal credit of board members

### BUSINESS CREDIT FUNDAMENTALS

**Business Credit vs. Personal Credit:**
- Business credit tied to EIN (not SSN)
- Separate credit reports (Dun & Bradstreet, Experian Business, Equifax Business)
- Can improve business borrowing capacity without affecting personal credit
- Takes 6-24 months to build meaningful business credit

**Key Credit Bureaus:**
1. **Dun & Bradstreet (D&B)** - Most important for business

1. **Create Free Dun & Bradstreet Account:**
   - Go to: https://www.dnb.com/

   - Create free accounts to monitor

#### PHASE 2: ESTABLISH TRADE REFERENCES (Weeks 4-12)

**STEP 1: Open Vendor Accounts That Report to Credit Bureaus**

**Key Strategy:** Start with vendors that report to D&B and other bureaus.

**Vendor Accounts to Open (Start Small):**

**Tier 1: Easy Approval, Report to Credit Bureaus**

1. **Quill Office Supplies**
   - Website: www.quill.com
   - Reports to: D&B, Experian
   - Credit line: $500-2,000
   - Net-30 payment terms
   - Easy approval for nonprofits

2. **Uline Shipping Supplies**
   - Website: www.uline.com
   - Reports to: D&B, Experian
   - Credit line: $500-3,000
   - Net-30 payment terms
   - Approval: Easy

3. **Grainger Industrial Supply**
   - Website: www.grainger.com
   - Reports to: D&B
   - Credit line: Varies
   - Net-30 payment terms
   - Good for equipment/tools

**Application Process:**
1. Go to vendor website
2. Look for "Apply for Net-30 Terms" or "Trade Credit Application"
3. Complete application using consistent business information
4. Provide:
   - Business name, address, phone (consistent!)
   - EIN: 39-3295288
   - DUNS Number: [Your DUNS]
   - Bank reference (your business bank account info)
   - Trade references (if you have existing vendors)
   - Personal guarantee (may be required initially)

**STEP 2: Use Credit Responsibly**

**Critical Best Practices:**
- Make small purchases initially ($50-200)
- Pay invoices EARLY (before 30-day due date)
- Build payment history over 3-6 months
- Gradually increase purchase amounts
- NEVER miss payments
- Pay in full (don't carry balances)

**Timeline:**
- Months 1-3: Make small purchases, pay early
- Months 4-6: Increase purchase amounts, continue perfect payment
- Months 7-12: Credit limits should increase, credit score building

#### PHASE 3: BUSINESS CREDIT CARDS (Months 6-12)

**STEP 1: Apply for Business Credit Cards**

**Wait until:** You have 6+ months of positive trade credit history

**Recommended Business Cards for Nonprofits:**

**Starter Cards (Easier Approval):**

1. **Capital One Spark Classic**
   - Good for building credit
   - 1% cash back
   - No annual fee
   - Reports to business credit bureaus

2. **Bank of America Business Advantage**
   - Cash back options
   - No annual fee
   - Good for nonprofits

**Once Established (Better Rewards):**

3. **Chase Ink Business Unlimited**
   - 1.5% cash back on all purchases
   - $0 annual fee
   - Good credit required

4. **American Express Blue Business Cash**
   - 2% cash back on first $50k/year
   - No annual fee
   - Excellent reporting to bureaus

**Application Tips:**
- Use business information (not personal)
- Provide EIN (not SSN if possible - though personal guarantee often required)
- Start with lower credit limits
- Build gradually

**STEP 2: Use Business Credit Cards Strategically**

**Best Practices:**
- Use for regular operating expenses
- Pay in full each month (no interest)
- Utilize cash back rewards
- Keep utilization under 30% (ideally under 10%)
- Set up automatic payments to never miss

**Example Monthly Usage:**
- Put recurring expenses on card:
  - Office supplies
  - Software subscriptions
  - Utilities
  - Fuel (for SPV vehicles)
  - Insurance payments
- Track in accounting system
- Pay in full before due date
- Earn cash back rewards

#### PHASE 4: MONITOR AND MAINTAIN (Ongoing)

**STEP 1: Set Up Credit Monitoring**

**Free Monitoring:**
- D&B Credit Signal: Free basic monitoring
- Experian Business: Free basic monitoring
- Nav.com: Free business credit monitoring (3 bureaus)

**Paid Monitoring (Optional, $30-100/month):**
- CreditSafe
- D&B Credit Builder
- Experian Business Credit Advantage

**RECOMMENDATION:** Start with free monitoring. Upgrade to paid only if actively seeking financing.

**STEP 2: Regular Credit Checks**

**Quarterly (January, April, July, October):**
- [ ] Check D&B credit report
- [ ] Check Experian Business credit report
- [ ] Verify all information accurate
- [ ] Dispute any errors immediately
- [ ] Review credit utilization
- [ ] Review payment history

**STEP 3: Maintain Perfect Payment History**

**Critical Rules:**
- NEVER miss a payment (set up automatic payments)
- Pay vendor invoices early
- Pay credit cards in full monthly
- Keep credit utilization low (under 30%)
- Maintain consistent business information everywhere

**STEP 4: Build Positive Credit Events**

**As Business Grows:**
- Add more trade credit accounts
- Increase credit limits (request increases annually)
- Diversify credit types (vendors, credit cards, potentially small loans)
- Maintain mix of revolving (credit cards) and installment (loans) credit

### CREDIT BUILDING TIMELINE

| **19-24** | Apply for better credit products | Higher limits, better terms |

### USING BUSINESS CREDIT FOR SPV VEHICLE FINANCING
