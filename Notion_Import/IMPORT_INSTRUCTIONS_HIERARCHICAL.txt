🎯 HROC HIERARCHICAL NOTION IMPORT
==================================

📦 WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS PACKAGE
---------------------------------------
This package creates a STRUCTURED workspace with:
- 1 parent/hub page (00_HROC_Operations_Hub.md)
- 6 child pages that nest underneath (01-06)

Result: Clean, organized sidebar navigation!


🚀 IMPORT INSTRUCTIONS (3 MINUTES)
===================================

STEP 1: Import All 7 Files
---------------------------
1. Open Notion (app or web)
2. Navigate to where you want HROC workspace
3. Select ALL 7 .md files in this folder:
   - 00_HROC_Operations_Hub.md (THE PARENT PAGE)
   - 01_Getting_Started_After_501c3.md
   - 02_SPV_Management_Guide.md
   - 03_Compliance_Calendar_2025_2026.md
   - 04_Officer_Transition_Critical_Tasks.md
   - 05_Web_Accessibility_Checklist.md
   - 06_IRS_Communications_Log.md

4. Drag all 7 files into Notion at once
5. Wait for import to complete (10-15 seconds)

✅ All 7 pages should now be visible in Notion


STEP 2: Create the Hierarchy (1 minute)
----------------------------------------
Right now, all 7 pages are at the same level. Let's organize them:

1. In your Notion sidebar, find these 7 pages
2. One by one, DRAG each page (01-06) ONTO the "00_HROC_Operations_Hub" page
3. When you drag a page onto another, it becomes a child page

Do this for all 6 pages (01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06)

Your sidebar should now look like:
```
🏛️ HROC Operations Hub
├── ✨ Getting Started After 501(c)(3)
├── 🚀 SPV Management Guide
├── 📅 Compliance Calendar 2025-2026
├── 🔄 Officer Transition Critical Tasks
├── ♿ Web Accessibility Checklist
└── 📬 IRS Communications Log
```

✅ Perfect! You have a clean, organized structure


STEP 3: Read and Act (10 minutes)
----------------------------------
1. Open "🏛️ HROC Operations Hub" (the parent page)
2. Read the "URGENT: Critical Actions This Week" section
3. Open "🔄 Officer Transition Critical Tasks" page
4. Follow the steps listed there
5. Add critical deadlines to your calendar:
   - Oct 28, 2025: SPV BOI Report DUE
   - May 15, 2026: Form 990 DUE


🤖 STEP 4: Enhance with AI (Optional - 30-60 min)
==================================================

Want databases, automation, and tracking instead of static pages?

1. Find the file: MASTER_NOTION_PROMPTS.md
   Location: /Users/jonathanmallinger/Documents/HROC_Files/

2. Open it in a text editor or Notion

3. Choose your path:
   - QUICK: Use "THE ONE MASTER PROMPT" (30 min)
   - PROFESSIONAL: Follow all 12 prompts (60 min)

4. Copy prompts from that file, paste into Notion AI

Result: Interactive databases, reminders, dashboards!


⚡ THE FASTEST WAY
===================

1. Import all 7 files (drag & drop)
2. Nest 6 pages under the hub page (drag onto it)
3. Read "Critical Actions" section
4. Schedule board meeting this week
5. Add Oct 28 to calendar
✅ Done! You're operational in 5 minutes
