## 🤖 THE ONE ESSENTIAL AI PROMPT

After importing, open your "03_Compliance_Calendar" page and use this ONE prompt:

**Copy this ENTIRE block and paste into Notion AI:**

```
Create a comprehensive "Master Compliance Tracker" database for HROC nonprofit with these exact properties and entries:

PROPERTIES:
- Task/Filing (title)
- Due Date (date)
- Category (select: Federal | State | SPV | Organizational)
- Frequency (select: Monthly | Quarterly | Annual | One-time)
- Status (select: 🔴 Overdue | 🟡 Due Soon | ⏳ Upcoming | ✅ Complete)
- Priority (select: 🔴 Critical | 🟡 Important | 🟢 Standard)
- Owner (person)
- Notes (text)

POPULATE WITH THESE CRITICAL DEADLINES:
1. Form 990 for 2025 | May 15, 2026 | Federal | Annual | Critical
2. WA Annual Report - HROC | July 31, 2026 | State | Annual | Critical
3. WA Annual Report - SPV LLC | July 31, 2026 | State | Annual | Critical
4. SPV BOI Report to FinCEN | October 28, 2025 | Federal | One-time | Critical
5. Annual Conflict of Interest Disclosures | January 2026 | Organizational | Annual | Important

7. SPV Monthly Financial Statement | 5th of each month | SPV | Monthly | Important
8. SPV Quarterly Board Report | Quarterly | SPV | Quarterly | Important

CREATE THESE VIEWS:
1. Calendar View showing all deadlines visually
2. Table View filtered to "Critical" priority only
3. Table View filtered to "Due in next 30 days"
4. Kanban View grouped by Status

Set Calendar View as default. Add reminders: 30 days, 14 days, and 7 days before each critical deadline.
